13. How many observations (i.e. rows) are in this data frame?

b) 129
c) 153
d) 160

c)

14. What is the value of Ozone in the 47th row? [0.25]

15. How many missing values are in the Ozone column of this data frame? [0.25]
a) 37
b) 9
c) 43
d) 78
16. What is the mean of the Ozone column in this dataset? Exclude missing values (coded as NA)
from this calculation. [0.5]

b) 31.5
c) 18.0
d) 53.2
17. What was the maximum Ozone value in the month of May (i.e. Month is equal to 5)? [0.5]

b) 115
c) 18
d) 100
18. Suppose I define the following function in R: [0.25]
cube <- function(x, n) {
}
x^3
What is the result of running
cube(3)
a) An error is returned because 'n' is not specified in the call to 'cube'
b) The number 27 is returned
c) A warning is given with no value returned.
d) The users is prompted to specify the value of 'n'.
19. The following code will produce a warning in R. [0.5]
x <- 1:10
if(x > 5) {
x <- 0
}Why?
a) There are no elements in 'x' that are greater than 5
b) You cannot set 'x' to be 0 because 'x' is a vector and 0 is a scalar.
c) The syntax of this R expression is incorrect.
d) 'x' is a vector of length 10 and 'if' can only test a single logical statement.
e) The expression uses curly braces.
20. Consider the following function [0.5]
f <- function(x) {
g <- function(y) {
y + z
}
z <- 4 x
+ g(x)
}

z <-
10 f(3)

a) 10
b) 7
c) 16
d) 4
21. Consider the following expression: [0.25]
x <- 5
y <- if(x < 3) {
NA
} else {
10
}
What is the value of 'y' after evaluating this expression?
a) 3b) 10
c) 5
d) NA
22. Consider the following R function [0.5]
h <- function(x, y = NULL, d = 3L) {
z <- cbind(x,
d) if(!is.null(y))
z <- z + y
else
z <- z + f
g <- x + y / z
if(d == 3L)
return(g)
g <- g + 10
g
}
Which symbol in the above function is a free variable?
a) f
b) z
c) d
d) l
e) g
23. What is an environment in R? [0.25]
a) an R package that only contains data
b) a collection of symbol/value pairs
c) a list whose elements are all functions
d) a special type of function
24. The R language uses what type of scoping rule for resolving free variables? [0.25]
a) global scoping
b) compilation scoping
c) dynamic scoping
d) lexical scoping25. How are free variables in R functions resolved? [0.5]
a) The values of free variables are searched for in the working directory
b) The values of free variables are searched for in the environment in which the function
was defined
c) The values of free variables are searched for in the global environment
d) The values of free variables are searched for in the environment in which the function was
called
26. What is one of the consequences of the scoping rules used in R? [0.5]
a) R objects cannot be larger than 100 MB
b) All objects must be stored in memory  ---------
c) Functions cannot be nested
d) All objects can be stored on the disk


27. In R, what is the parent frame? [0.5]
a) It is the environment in which a function was called
b) It is the environment in which a function was defined
c) It is always the global environment
d) It is the package search list
28. Take a look at the 'iris' dataset that comes with R. The data can be loaded with
the code: library(datasets)
data(iris)
A description of the dataset can be found
by running ?iris
There will be an object called 'iris' in your workspace. In this dataset, what is the mean of
'Sepal.Length' for the species virginica? Please round your answer to the nearest whole
number. [0.5]
29. Continuing with the 'iris' dataset from the previous Question, what R code returns a vector of
the means of the variables 'Sepal.Length', 'Sepal.Width', 'Petal.Length', and 'Petal.Width'? [0.5]
a) colMeans(iris)
b) apply(iris, 1, mean)
c) apply(iris, 2, mean)
d) apply(iris[, 1:4], 1, mean)
e) apply(iris[, 1:4], 2, mean)
f) rowMeans(iris[, 1:4])30. Whatâ€™s the value of f(3)? [0.5]
y<-10
f<-function (x) {
y <- 2
y^2+g(x)
}
g<-function(x) {
x*y
}
